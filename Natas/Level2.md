# Level 2

## Quest
We are greeted with a simple message "There is nothing on this page".

<br/>

## Solution
Again we look at the source code and this time we find an image tag `<img src="files/pixel.png">`.

Our image is located in `files` folder, so lets see what is in `files` folder.

<br/>
<br/>

Now we can see that in files folder there is another file named `users.txt` apart from our image file. When we open the `users.txt` file, password for next level is revealed.
