# Natas

Natas is a wargame that teaches the basics of serverside web-security. My sole reason for solving Natas is that its backend is written in PHP. Having done a bit of PHP recently, Natas seemed like a Natural choice to test my new found skill.

More about Natas can be found found at their [homepage.](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) (_actually it doesn't say much_ ¯\\_(ツ )_/¯ )
