## Quest
Now we are greeted with a webpage similar to previous level, but when we look at its source code, we see there are no obvious hints.

## Solution
There is a subtle hint in the line : "_Not even Google will find it this time..."_. Google crawlers usually look at `robots.txt` of websites to decide which of its pages it can index and which it can't.When we visit `robots.txt` , we see only one path which is disallowed.

When we visit it, this finally reveals the password for next level.
